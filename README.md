## Description of the project

-   In the scope of this project, there is a data set that will be analyzed. Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and other libraries will be used for data processing. The aim is to perform preprocessing, cleaning, and other operations on the columns, as well as data merging.
- In this project, I will be using Jupyter Notebook to prepare the GitHub repository. This will allow me to create and share interactive data science notebooks with the rest of the team. I will be able to combine code, text, and visualizations in a single document, and use it to explore and analyze the data, as well as document and share my findings with others.
